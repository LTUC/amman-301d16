# The Call Stack & Debugging

## Feature Tasks

- Use the VSCode extension `PrintCode` to create an image of your code from lab 9 including line numbers. See diagram for a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

- Upload the image of your code into the shared virtual whiteboard.
- Using the drawing tools in shared virtual whiteboard, draw arrows to indicate where each function is being called.
- You and your partner(s) will be annotating the code, line by line. Take notes, build the call stack, and draw a WRRC diagram as you trace execution of the code. Be creative - utilize colors, symbols, arrow tools, and so on, but do not feel like you need to be overly artistic.
- If you find a bug in the code, make a note but proceed as if the code were fully functional.
- Plan to spend approximately two hours on one partners' `server.js` code, then switch roles.
- When you are reviewing your own code:
  - You are in charge of drawing a single WRRC diagram of the pieces involved. Your diagram must include the following terms: request, response, client, query, server, database, model, view, controller, port.
  - Indicate the line(s) of code from your `server.js` file that corresponds to each portion of the diagram.
- When you are reviewing your partner's code:
  - You are in charge of tracing the order in which the code is executed. Write notes, numbering the steps, directly on the `server.js` screenshot image.
  - Animate the call stack using Post-It notes or other whiteboard functionality, adding and removing functions as you trace the code execution. As appropriate, include the numbered step on the Post-It note.
- After two hours have passed, switch roles and repeat these steps using your partner's code. Make sure to trace different portions of the code base (e.g.: pick up where you left off).
