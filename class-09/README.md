## Code Refactoring Stretgies
  - Putting functions together based on their kind
    - Contructors
    - Route Handlers / Controllers
  - Commenting our code
  - Minimize code using more expressive syntax like arrow functions, map, filter, reduce
  - Meaningful Variable and Function Names
  - Use functions instead of duplicating code
  - Declare some variables at the top of our code
