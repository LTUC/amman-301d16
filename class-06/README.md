## What to focus on learning today

-  How to build a route* on the server, which can respond to a client request with a json object.

## Weekly Feedback
- Class Session
    - Losing Focus
        - Break Every 40 - 45mins, for 10 minutes.
        - Start lab topic earlier
        - Do Code Review last
    - Not keeping up with Native English
        - I'll slow it down more.
        - Use more common language terms
        - Use lower level and more detailed context
    - Faces on camera distracting, don't want to wear Hijab all day
        - Camera on only when speaking [Optional]

- Course Structure
    - Less Reading, More Practice.
    - A lot of work, too intense
        - 18 days - 22 days
    - Should do lab alone.
        - Review benefits of pair programming
    - Want to master one skill before being introduced to another.
        - Review stacked learning

## Lesson Overview

Today we will take a step into the back end, beginning to write a proper `server.js` file to serve API data to the City Explorer client application. You will continue to build out this file through lab 9, working with a new partner each day.

Another component of this portion of the course involves working with a static client which you have no control over. You will be able to view the source code for this client, but will not be permitted to modify it in anyway. Servers and clients are separate entities; the only relationships that exist between them are the relationships we create. This week, you will be creating those relationships.
